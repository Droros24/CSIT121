        <h3>What I've Learned</h3>
         <p>So far I am feeling fairly comfortable using html. The syntax and semantics seem very intuitive and not too difficult to grasp. I have learned to organize the web page far more easily using the headers! I have also learned how to incorporate a hyperlink in html which has allowed me to link my projects to my main page on GitHub. I have also learned to how to bring up the preveiw page so that I can check my page as it is being worked on. So far this has been a lot of fun and I can't wait to learn more! </p>
