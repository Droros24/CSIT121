        <p>My first webpage that I've built on my own! So far I am feeling confindent and excited to use html. Looking forward to learning more!</p>
       

        
        <h3>What I've Learned</h3>
         <p>So far I am feeling fairly comfortable using html. The syntax and semantics seem very intuitive and not too difficult to grasp. I have learned to organize the web page far more easily using the headers! I have also learned how to incorporate a hyperlink in html which has allowed me to link my projects to my main page on GitHub. I have also learned to how to bring up the preveiw page so that I can check my page as it is being worked on. So far this has been a lot of fun and I can't wait to learn more! </p>

        <h2>Lab 3</h2>
        <h3>This week I learned:</h3>
        <p class="lab3">This week I learned about styling my html files with css. I used a few different resources to find all the different styling tools available. For example in my resources used section i added a text shadow effect that I found on W3. In this paragraph I am using a class selector to differentiate the style of my other paragraphs on this page. Overall it was exciting to learn these new stylistic tools, not just to mess around with but also to be able to think how I can implement these to emphasize and articulate importance on a real businesses website. I did find the amount of options a bit overwhelming when deciding what css to use but I'm sure the more the research the more comforatable I'll become!</p>
