            <p>My first webpage that I've built on my own! So far I am feeling confident and excited to use HTML. Looking forward to learning more!</p>
           
            <h3>What I've Learned</h3>
             <p>So far I am feeling fairly comfortable using HTML. The syntax and semantics seem very intuitive and not too difficult to grasp. I have learned to organize the web page far more easily using the headers! I have also learned how to incorporate a hyperlink in HTML which has allowed me to link my projects to my main page on GitHub. I have also learned how to bring up the preview page so that I can check my page as it is being worked on. So far this has been a lot of fun and I can't wait to learn more!</p>

            <h2>Lab 3</h2>
            <h3>This week I learned:</h3>
            <p class="lab3">This week I learned about styling my HTML files with CSS. I used a few different resources to find all the different styling tools available. For example, in my resources used section I added a text shadow effect that I found on W3. In this paragraph, I am using a class selector to differentiate the style of my other paragraphs on this page. Overall, it was exciting to learn these new stylistic tools, not just to mess around with but also to be able to think about how I can implement these to emphasize and articulate importance on a real business's website. I did find the amount of options a bit overwhelming when deciding what CSS to use, but I'm sure the more research I do, the more comfortable I'll become!</p>

            <h2>Lab 5</h2>
            <h3> What I've Learned</h3>
            <p class = "lab5">This week I learned about link anchors and media queries. I found it to be very insightful as we have all come across a website that may be desktop friendly but very difficult to navigate on mobile devices. I've learned that mobile devices have no surpassed desktops when it comes to web traffic. According to Kinsta mobile devices are now accounting for over 51% of web traffic. This being said, it is very important to make sure your websites are not only desktop friendly but also mobile and table friendly to keep up with current demands. I learned the min and max width of px for each device as setting @media to a max 600px will be used to design the mobile experience, between 601px and 900px can be used to design tablet experiences and anything from 901px and greater will help design the desktop experience.  </p>

            <h2>Best Design Practices</h2>
              <p class ="bestDesign">When designing a website it is best to think of how you want to organize it prior to entering all the content. To start every page is made of rows, you should conside the layout you would like before beginning in rows and columns. These rows backgrounds should not be the same twice. This will help differentiate the rows and content within them. You should also have the content you need before you layout the website. Similar to wordpressing, information hierachry is key when design a well organized website. Having the content before creating the layout will let you organzie the information properly so you can design the website based off key content.  </p>
