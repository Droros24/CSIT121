      <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
      <p>Throughout this semester I have learned many skills that will surely become useful in my future endeavors. Starting with the basics of understanding what is a URL and what information is being displayed is an amazing fundamental that people skip over everyday. Almost everyone uses the internet, but very few actually understand the design of URLs. I believe actually understanding what files and domains are being accessed is important when navigating the web.</p>
      <p>While learning HTML it intially seemed very intuitive. As we progressed there began to be so many more pieces to the puzzle that required me to thoughtfully approach a lab and create a plan prior to beginning to code. One of the best ways to approach this was using systems of information hiearchy. Establishing the main headers then breaking the website down from h1 to h2, h3, etc. really helped create a starting point and organize the website in conducive way. This also played a key role when moving into CSS. By establish headers and classes it allowed me to style informaiton in a hierachy that was very noticable by the difference in color, font, size, bold, etc. </p>
      <p>Overall, this class was extremely enjoyable. It allowed me to make my own portfolio of all the work that I have completed during the semester and often gave us the freedom to choose topics that interested us. Using resources like W3, youtube, and stackoverflow really helped reinforce what we were learning each week. It also gave inspiration to learn more and try more methods of design then just what we covered in our course content. I want to thank professor Brown for a great semester and am excited to continue my IT journey at CCBC!</p>
